Blue Chip Down takes place in 2007 during Great Recession. A large portion of the game is the buying and selling of stocks. I was stuck on this portion for a long time until Mrs. Kiang helped me to get unstuck. One of the puzzles is talking to one of you clients. Based on her response to the first thing you say to her you can tell that she prefers more abrupt answers. So further on in the dialogue you have the choice between a long or short answer if you choose the short one you succeed but if you choose the long one you have a only one in three chance. Another puzzle is hacking into a competitor’s computer by observing their cubical and finding their password under a stapler so that you can mess with their stocks. Another is taking the position of CEO by getting the previous one fired. To do this you need to talk to their assistant and getting her to give you his password. They you can log into his computer and if you post some obscene photos he has taken from his account you can get him fired. A number of my friends including Andrew Winnicki, Philip Tanton, and Emily Lung tested my game. I beta tested Ty’s game. The beta testers helped a lot with alternate phrasing. They typed in things that are synonymous with what I had coded but that I hadn’t thought of. I am most proud of getting the stock trading working albeit with a lot of help. I was able to root out a few bugs in Ty’s game dealing with doors. Next time I would choose a project with a narrower focus so that I could focus more on the mechanics that really matter.
