"BlueChipDown" by Jonathan Nakagawa

When play begins: say "'Hurry up! I thought I asked you for those copies five minutes ago and this coffee is cold get me another.' You have had this job for less than two days and already contimplated 'acidently' pushing your Boss out a window 12 times. 'Hell, Michael was a better assitant than you are and he couldn't tell the differance between a pen and pencil.' Your jaw begins to ache from holding tightly clenched shut to contain the fowl stream of profanity that you would otherwise end up hurrling at your boss. Standing up from the file you've been sorting you turn to your boss and manage to say, 'Alright I'm going to make copies and get your coffee i'll be back soon.' His face turns and even darker shade of red as he shouts, 'No! You stay here I don't want to have to wait another hour for my coffee.'"

[Code to display a players location in the game and possible exits in the header.]
When play begins:
now left hand status line is "Exits: [exit list]";
now right hand status line is "[location]".

To say exit list:
	let place be location;
	repeat with way running through directions:
		let place be the room way from the location;
		if place is a room, say "[way]".
