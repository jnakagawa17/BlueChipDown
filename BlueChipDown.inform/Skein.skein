&quot;Hurry up! I thought I asked you for those copies five minutes ago.&quot; You have had this internship a Merrill Lynch, one of the largest investment companies in the world, for less than two days and already contemplated &quot;accidently&quot; pushing your Boss out a window 12 times. Standing up from the file you&apos;ve been sorting you turn to your boss and manage to say, &quot;Alright I&apos;m going to make copies just give me ten seconds.&quot; His face turns and even darker shade of red as he shouts, &quot;No! You stay here I don&apos;t want to have to wait another hour.&quot; and leaves the room.

An Interactive Fiction by Jonathan Nakagawa
Release 1 / Serial number 141028 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Boss&apos;s Cubical
 Perhaps this room, if it can even be called a room, is the reason your Boss is constantly angry. Barely large enough for you to take a step in any direction everything is within easy arms reach. Not that there is much here an old computer sitting on a desk, a filling cabinet, and corded phone. The computer is insistently beeping.

Everyone else has 3 hours to pack and leave.&quot; You can&apos;t afford to lose this job.

I think you will make a fine broker better than we could hire right now. We are keeping you on.&quot; Just as Jonathan finished talking his cellphone started to ring. &quot;Excuse me for a moment. Hello. Yes this is Jonathan. What! No! I never did that! Here he is.&quot; He hands the phone to you. &quot;Hello I&apos;m Andrew head of Merrill Lynch&apos;s Board of Directors. Jonathan uploaded some obscene photos and the media are having field day. So he is going to be fired to save face. We would have appointed you but another broker Philip has out performed you.&quot; ***
