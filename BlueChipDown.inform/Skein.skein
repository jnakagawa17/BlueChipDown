&quot;Hurry up! I thought I asked you for those copies five minutes ago.&quot; You have had this internship a Merrill Lynch, one of the largest investment companies in the world, for less than two days and already contimplated &quot;acidently&quot; pushing your Boss out a window 12 times. Standing up from the file you&apos;ve been sorting you turn to your boss and manage to say, &quot;Alright I&apos;m going to make copies just give me ten seconds.&quot; His face turns and even darker shade of red as he shouts, &quot;No! You stay here I don&apos;t want to have to wait another hour.&quot; and leaves the room.

An Interactive Fiction by Jonathan Nakagawa
Release 1 / Serial number 141027 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Boss&apos;s Cubical
 Perhaps this room, if it can even be called a room, is the reason your Boss is constantly angry. Barely large enough for you to take a step in any direction everything is within easy arms reach. Not that there is much here an old computer sitting on a desk, a filling cabinet, and corded phone. The computer is insistantly beeping.

The computer stops its insistant bleeping. Thank hevans that you managed to sell everything before they tanked any more. A voice booms out from a hidden speaker, &quot;All employees come directly to the meeting room.&quot; You think you get to the meeting room by going south out of your office, west through the hallway into the elevator, down to the ground floor, and finally south from the lobby.

Everyone else has 3 hours to pack and leave.&quot; You can&apos;t afford to lose this job.
