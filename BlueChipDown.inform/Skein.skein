&quot;Hurry up! I thought I asked you for those copies five minutes ago and this coffee is cold get me another.&quot; You have had this job for less than two days and already contimplated &quot;acidently&quot; pushing your Boss out a window 12 times. &quot;Hell, Michael was a better assitant than you are and he couldn&apos;t tell the differance between a pen and pencil.&quot; Your jaw begins to ache from holding tightly clenched shut to contain the fowl stream of profanity that you would otherwise end up hurrling at your boss. Standing up from the file you&apos;ve been sorting you turn to your boss and manage to say, &quot;Alright I&apos;m going to make copies and get your coffee i&apos;ll be back soon.&quot; His face turns and even darker shade of red as he shouts, &quot;No! You stay here I don&apos;t want to have to wait another hour for my coffee.&quot;

Boss&apos;s Cubical
Perhaps this room, if it can even be called a room, is the reason your Boss is constantly angry. Barely large enough for you to take a step in any direction everything is within easy arms reach. Not that there is much here an old computer sitting on a desk, a filling cabinet, and corded phone.

From day to day your Boss never seem change his appearence. He must own at least a dozen of the same set of plain clothes. Whenever he sees you his face turns a deep beetroot red and he seems to inflate.

You can also see Filling Cabinet (closed) here.
