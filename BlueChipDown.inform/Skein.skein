&quot;Hurry up! I thought I asked you for those copies five minutes ago.&quot; You have had this internship a Merrill Lynch, one of the largest investment companies in the world, for less than two days and already contimplated &quot;acidently&quot; pushing your Boss out a window 12 times. Standing up from the file you&apos;ve been sorting you turn to your boss and manage to say, &quot;Alright I&apos;m going to make copies just give me ten seconds.&quot; His face turns and even darker shade of red as he shouts, &quot;No! You stay here I don&apos;t want to have to wait another hour.&quot; and leaves the room.

An Interactive Fiction by Jonathan Nakagawa

Boss&apos;s Cubical
 Perhaps this room, if it can even be called a room, is the reason your Boss is constantly angry. Barely large enough for you to take a step in any direction everything is within easy arms reach. Not that there is much here an old computer sitting on a desk, a filling cabinet, and corded phone. The computer is insistantly beeping.

The DOW just droped 250 points in one day and our analyists predict it isn&apos;t going to get better for a very long time. Therefore, merrill Lynch will not be able to keep all of you. In fact we can only keep three. It shouldn&apos;t surrpise anyone that we are keeping Andrew who has been our most sucsessful trader for 2 years straight now. The other two are a bit more surrprising Philip and employee number 27?&quot; Your Boss perks up and says, &quot;That would be me sir.&quot; &quot;Ah of course well you can stay.
