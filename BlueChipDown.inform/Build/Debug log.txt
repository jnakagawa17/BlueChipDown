Problem PM_MisalignedIndentation issued from inform7/Chapter 13/Rule Subtrees.w, line 414

  >--> The phrase or rule definition 'Instead of asking someone about
    something' (source text, line 22) is written using the 'colon and
    indentation' syntax for its 'if's, 'repeat's and 'while's, where blocks of
    phrases grouped together are indented one tab step inward from the 'if
    ...:' or similar phrase to which they belong. But the tabs here seem to be
    misaligned, and I can't determine the structure. The first phrase going
    awry in the definition seems to be 'let the source be the conversation of
    the noun' (source text, line 23), in case that helps. This sometimes
    happens even when the code looks about right, to the eye, if rows of spaces
    have been used to indent phrases instead of tabs.

    text, line 37) is written using the 'colon and indentation' syntax for its
    'if's, 'repeat's and 'while's, where blocks of phrases grouped together are
    indented one tab step inward from the 'if ...:' or similar phrase to which
    they belong. But the tabs here seem to be misaligned, and I can't determine
    the structure. The first phrase going awry in the definition seems to be
    'repeat with speaker running through other people' (source text, line 38),
    in case that helps. This sometimes happens even when the code looks about
    right, to the eye, if rows of spaces have been used to indent phrases
    instead of tabs.
